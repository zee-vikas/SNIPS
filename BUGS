hostmon
-------
 - error in parsing client data causes variables to show up as Critical
   (especially DFspace). Probably due to errors in regexp pattern.
   Should be fixed in v1.2

genweb.cgi
----------
When using nsmon, the Device name of dns servers in the web report are
all in the format:   "domain name"+"dns server name"

	e.g. "pacific.net.sg+ns5"

And it seems your genweb.cgi reads & compares the 'updates' file in the
fashion of "dns server name" only. Such that all the records in updates
are not matched. Here is a typical line from 'updates'

  pacific.net.sg+ns5:203.120.92.139:named-status  dont care -nocol01
